💻 My React Portfolio
Welcome to my React project portfolio, where I document my learning journey and progress in building interactive web applications. Through these projects, I explore key concepts such as state management, API consumption, performance optimization, and intuitive UI design.

🚀 Featured Projects
🎲 Tic Tac Toe
A classic Tic Tac Toe game focused on game logic implementation, state management using useState, and creating a responsive, interactive experience.

🖱️ Mouse Follower
An application that tracks mouse movement in real-time, demonstrating the use of useEffect for event handling and enhancing interactivity in React applications.

🐱 API Technical Test
A hands-on API consumption exercise where a random fact is fetched from an API and dynamically used in another. This project reinforces skills in fetch, data manipulation, and error handling.

🎬 Movie Finder
A movie search app based on the OMDb API, featuring optimizations such as debounce, automatic searching, and duplicate request prevention.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React – Building dynamic user interfaces.
JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic and interactivity.
CSS – Responsive design and styling.
APIs – External data integration.
This portfolio reflects my growth as a frontend developer and my ability to build scalable and efficient applications. 🚀
