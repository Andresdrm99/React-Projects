# Technical Test for React Juniors and Trainees in Live Coding

## APIs

- **Random Facts:** [https://catfact.ninja/fact](https://catfact.ninja/fact)
- **Random Image:** [https://cataas.com/cat/says/hello](https://cataas.com/cat/says/hello)

## Tasks

1. Retrieve a random cat fact from the API `https://catfact.ninja/fact`.
2. Extract the first word from the fact.
3. Display an image of a cat with the first word obtained, using the API `https://cataas.com/cat/says/{word}`.

## Technical Skills This Test Helps Me Learn and Validate

- **API Consumption:** I get to practice how to fetch data from external APIs and handle asynchronous responses effectively.
- **Data Manipulation:** It allows me to work with data by extracting specific pieces of information, such as the first word of a string, and use it for other tasks.
- **React Fundamentals:** It helps me improve my understanding of React, specifically working with components and managing state when interacting with external data.
- **Error Handling:** I practice handling potential errors in API calls and ensuring that the app provides the right feedback to users.
- **Live Coding:** This test helps me refine my ability to solve problems on the spot and code in a live scenario, simulating real-world challenges.
